      <h2>For Bicepes and triceps</h2>
      <h3>Dumbbell Floor Press</h3>
      <p>
        <br /><b>Why it rocks: </b> Your super stable position in this move
        allows you to challenge your triceps with heavier weights than in many
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How to: </b>Start lying on back with knees bent and feet flat on the
        floor. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with elbows out about 45 degrees
        from sides. Keep lower back pressed into floor, press weights straight
        up over chest, and extend arms. Pause for a moment, then slowly bend
        elbows to lower weights back down until backs of upper arms return to
        floor. That's one rep. Complete 8 to 10 reps.
      </p>
      <h3>Single-Arm Dumbbell Floor Press</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Why it rocks:</b> In addition to isolating each arm at a time (a must
        for avoiding strength or muscle imbalances!), this single-arm floor
        press variation also challenges your core to keep you stable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How to:</b> Start lying on back with knees bent and feet flat on the
        floor. Hold a dumbbell in left hand with left elbow out about 45 degrees
        from side. Rest right arm flat on floor. Keep lower back pressed into
        floor, press weight straight up over chest, and extend left arm. Pause
        for a moment, then slowly bend elbow to lower weight back down until
        back of upper left arm returns to floor. That's one rep. Complete 8 to
        10 reps on your left side, then repeat on your right for a full set.
      </p>

      <h3>Alternating Dumbbell Floor Press</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Why it rocks:</b> Alternating floor presses give your arms a little
        more rest than pressing both sides together so you can push extra
        weight. They also hit your core a little harder.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How to:</b> Start lying on back with knees bent and feet flat on the
        floor. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with elbows out about 45 degrees
        from sides. Keep lower back pressed into floor, press weights straight
        up over chest, and extend arms. From here, bend left elbow to lower
        weight down until back of upper left arm returns to floor. Reverse the
        movement to press left weight back up to meet right. Repeat with right
        arm. That's one rep. Complete 8 to 10 reps.
      </p>

      <h3>Pushups</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Why it rocks:</b> The pushup is an all-around power move, working
        your chest, back, core, glutes, triceps, and biceps at once. Maintain
        your form and it's a fast-track to stronger tris.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How to:</b> Start in a high plank position with shoulders over
        wrists. Keep core tight, bend elbows, and lower body toward floor, until
        arms form 90-degree angles. (Elbows should point 45 degrees away from
        sides.) Press back to start position. That's one rep. Complete 8 to 10
        reps.
      </p>

      <h3>Close-Grip Pushup</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Why it rocks:</b> Compared to the standard pushup, the close-grip
        pushup places greater emphasis on your triceps, hitting all three heads
        hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> How to:</b> Start in a high plank position, but with hands directly
        beneath chest instead of shoulders. Bend elbows straight back towards
        feet to lower body toward floor, keeping upper arms close to sides.
        Press back up to start. That's one rep. Complete 8 to 10 reps.
      </p>

      <h3>Crunches</h3>
      <p>
        For all you gym goers, this one is an old timer. It helps strengthens
        the rectus abdominis muscles in the midsection of your body.
      </p>
      To do Crunches -
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lie on your back with your knees bent, put your hands behind your
          head.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now lift your shoulders and raise your upper body off the floor.
          Slowly, return to starting position.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat this at least 20 times.</li>
        <p>
          You can do as many reps depending on your strength and stamina.
          Crunches can also be done with variations like side crunches, twist
          crunches, and reverse crunch.
        </p>
      </ul>

      </ul>

        etc.
